# SNAP

### SNP annotation recovery tool

A python framework to read in [VCF](http://www.1000genomes.org/node/101) files and a given [Genbank](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank) genome and
parse out the genes the SNPs occur in, and what if any changes in translation
occur.

### Current Goals

- Goal 1: Read in genome from Genbank, find position in CDS.
- Goal 2: Recover translation for gene and what, if any changes the SNP causes.
