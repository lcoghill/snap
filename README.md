# SNAP

### SNP annotation recovery tool

A python framework to read in [VCF](http://www.1000genomes.org/node/101) files and a given [Genbank](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank) genome and
parse out the genes the SNPs occur in, and what if any changes in translation
occur.

### Current Goals

- ~~Goal 1: Read in genome from Genbank~~
- ~~Goal 2: Find all CDS, and the sequence / translation.~~
- Goal 3: Find the position of each SNP in CDS.
- Goal 4: Build replace the SNP base and get new translation.
- Goal 5: Identify what changes in amino acids occur if any.
